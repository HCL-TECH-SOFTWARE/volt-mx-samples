				<string>1C8F.1 Declare this reason to access user defaults to read and write information that is only accessible to the apps, app extensions, and App Clips that are members of the same App Group as the app itself.

This reason does not permit reading information that was written by apps, app extensions, or App Clips outside the same App Group or by the system. Your app is not responsible if the system provides information from the global domain because a key is not present in your requested domain while your app is attempting to read information that apps, app extensions, or App Clips in your appâ€™s App Group write.

This reason also does not permit writing information that can be accessed by apps, app extensions, or App Clips outside the same App Group.</string>
