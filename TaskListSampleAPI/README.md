# ReactNativeIntegration_TaskListSample

You can integrate a React Native app (which is developed in React Native framework) into a Volt MX app (which is developed in Volt MX framework). The React Native app is embedded into the Volt MX form through a container, called as the React Native Container. Furthermore, some APIs are used to communicate between the React Native app's JavaScript framework and the Volt MX app's Volt MX framework. For more information on the feature, check out the documentation page <a href = "https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/react_Native_Container.html"> here </a>.

This app is a simple task list sample which shows a list of tasks as set by the user. One can add new tasks using the floating button on the home screen. One can also delete the tasks by swiping the rows of the segment. 

The list page of the app is built on Volt MX Iris platform. The pop up to add new tasks is built on React Native. The app shows integration of the react native project in Volt MX project and communication between those two.
